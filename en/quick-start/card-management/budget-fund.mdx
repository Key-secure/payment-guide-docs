title: Replenishing the Budget Account
---

Replenishing the budget account ensures smooth card issuance, transaction processing, and settlement, preventing failures caused by insufficient balance, transaction interruptions, or potential bank risk controls.

Navigate to: **Card Services > Card Management > Merchant Total Assets**, click **[Details]**, then select **[Replenish Budget Account (USD)]**. Follow the on-screen instructions to deposit digital currency, which will be automatically converted into your budget account balance.

<Note>
**Purpose of the Budget Account:**  
The budget account covers all costs related to card issuance, spending, and settlement. Insufficient funds may lead to card issuance failures, declined transactions, abnormal payment success rates, or bank risk control actions (e.g., card freezing, penalties). Always ensure the budget account has sufficient balance.
