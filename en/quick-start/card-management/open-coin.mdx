title: Setup Supported Coins
---

Configure supported coins to enable deposit and withdrawal functions for merchants, and set transaction rules to ensure secure fund operations and smooth refund processes.

Go to **“Operations Management” > “Merchant Coin Management”**, add the desired supported coins, and configure the following parameters:

* **Enable Deposit / Withdrawal:** When enabled, end-users can deposit or withdraw using the selected coin.
* **Minimum Deposit Amount:** Set the minimum threshold for deposits; only deposits meeting or exceeding this amount will be credited.
* **Minimum Withdrawal Amount:** Set the minimum withdrawal threshold to restrict end-user withdrawals.
* **Exchange Rate Slippage:** Set a slippage percentage for card payments to mitigate losses from cryptocurrency price fluctuations.
