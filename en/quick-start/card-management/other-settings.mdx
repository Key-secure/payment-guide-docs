Completing content configuration helps enhance the app’s brand image and user experience, while supporting marketing campaigns and compliance information display.

## Add App Homepage Carousel

Path: **“Content Management > Carousel Management”**

* Upload marketing image assets
* Set click-through links (e.g., redirect to card application page or promotional activity page)
* Support multiple carousel images to match different business themes

## Upload User Agreement and Customer Service Links

Path: **“Content Management > Other Configurations”**

* Upload legal documents such as **User Agreement** and **Privacy Policy** (supporting both Chinese and English versions)
