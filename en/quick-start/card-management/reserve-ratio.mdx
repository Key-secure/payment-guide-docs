title: Configure Reserve Ratio Strategy
---

Configuring a reserve ratio strategy allows automatic monitoring of the budget account's financial health, preventing cardholder transactions from failing due to insufficient balance.

Access **“Card Business > Card Management > Merchant Total Assets > Details”**, then click **[Manage Reserve Ratio]** to configure the budget account’s reserve strategy:

**Reserve Ratio Definition:**  
Budget Account Balance ÷ Total Assets of All Member Cards

**Risk Alert:**  
Select alert email addresses, alert message content, and alert frequency. When the reserve ratio reaches a high-risk level, the system will send notifications so you can replenish the budget account in time.

**Strategy Recommendation:**  
Set a reasonable threshold so the system can automatically remind you when budget replenishment is needed, ensuring successful card payments and operational liquidity.

<Tip>
1. C-end user asset changes (such as deposits and withdrawals) and budget account changes (such as card issuance, transactions, and refunds) will affect the reserve ratio.

2. The reserve ratio evaluates the merchant's asset capacity to support user spending. Continuous monitoring is recommended to maintain operational stability.
