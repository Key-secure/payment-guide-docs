title: Approving Withdrawal Requests
---

## Overview

Withdrawal requests initiated by members in the App are aggregated in the backend for management and approval. Merchant administrators can manually review requests on the withdrawal records page to ensure fund security and compliance. If automatic approval is enabled, the system can release small withdrawals based on preset thresholds, improving processing efficiency.

## Applicable Roles

* Merchant Administrator  
* Operations / Finance personnel with withdrawal approval permissions

2. Set the automatic approval threshold (e.g., 100 USD).  
3. Enable the automatic approval switch and save the configuration.

<Tip>
1. Requests below the configured threshold are automatically approved.  
2. Automatic approval triggers on-chain withdrawal and signature processes.  
3. It is recommended to use this in conjunction with risk control and wallet strategies to ensure fund security.
