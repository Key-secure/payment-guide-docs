title: Managing Financial Records
---

## Overview

Merchants can access **Financial Management** to view deposit records, withdrawal records, and card transaction records. This module allows monitoring fund flows, validating transaction legitimacy, and performing daily reconciliations and anomaly checks.

## Applicable Roles

* Finance Personnel  
* Merchant Administrators  
* Risk/Compliance Review Staff  

## Record Types

### 1. Deposit Records

Records of members depositing digital assets into the merchant's MPC wallet.

**Key fields:**

* Member ID  
* Deposit currency (e.g., USDT, ETH)  
* Blockchain network (e.g., Tron, Ethereum)  
* Deposit amount  
* Deposit address  
* TXID (transaction hash)  
* Status  

<Note>
Only after reaching the required on-chain confirmations will a deposit be considered successful by the system.  

Successful deposits are automatically credited to the memberâ€™s account balance.  

Failed or unconfirmed deposits will not be recorded.  

Finance staff are advised to regularly reconcile deposit amounts with on-chain transactions to ensure accuracy.
</Note>

### 2. Withdrawal Records

Displays member withdrawal requests to on-chain addresses. These require manual approval in the backend.

**Key fields:**

* Member ID  
* Withdrawal currency / network  
* Withdrawal amount  
* Withdrawal address  
* TXID (on-chain transaction hash)  
* Approval status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)  
* Approver / Approval time  

<Note>
Withdrawal requests must be manually approved (see Withdrawal Approval Workflow).  

Once approved, the system automatically triggers on-chain transfer via the MPC wallet and executes Co-signer signatures.  

Ensure that the MPC wallet has **sweeping enabled** and that the gas station wallet contains sufficient fees for the transaction.  

Common withdrawal failures are due to insufficient gas fees or incomplete sweeping. Regularly check wallet status to avoid delays.
</Note>

### 3. Card Transaction Records

Tracks all transactions conducted via virtual payment cards, including **authorization, settlement, and refund stages**.

**Key fields:**

* Transaction type  
* Transaction timestamp & status  
* Member information (ID, nickname)  
* Card details (card number / type)  
* Transaction amount & currency  
* Merchant name (location of transaction)  

**Account balance impact:**

1. Merchant budget account balance changes  
2. Member total asset changes
