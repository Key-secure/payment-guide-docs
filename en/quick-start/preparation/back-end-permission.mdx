title: System Permission Management
---

To ensure your organization members can safely and efficiently use the KeySecure payment card management system, please complete the following permission configuration and member management steps.

## Register Initial Administrator Account

Contact the KeySecure customer team to request merchant system access.  

Please prepare and provide the following information in advance:  
* Email address for binding the initial administrator account (this email will receive the first login link)

After verification, KeySecure will grant system login access to this email.

 

## Bind Two-Factor Authentication (Google Authenticator)

During the initial login, the administrator will be guided to bind **Google Authenticator (GA)** for two-factor authentication (2FA) login.

<Note>
- It is recommended to use a verified corporate email for admin login and GA binding.  
- If GA is lost, it can be reset in the backend or contact KeySecure support to unbind.
</Note>

 

## Create Organization Roles & Configure Page Permissions

After logging in, navigate to: **System Management > Merchant Role Management**  

You can create multiple roles according to your teamâ€™s needs (e.g., Operations, Finance, Technical Support) and assign menu permissions for each role.

| Example Role | Assignable Pages |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Finance Role | Financial Management, Revenue Management, Cost Management, etc. |
| Operations | Operations Management, Member Management, etc. |

## Add Organization Members & Assign Roles

Go to: **System Management > Merchant Admin Management**  

Add member emails, set basic info (name, position, etc.), and assign the corresponding roles.  

The system will automatically send invitation emails. Invited members can set their login password and bind GA to access the backend.

 

**After completing team setup, you will have the following capabilities:**  
* Multi-member collaborative management of payment card operations  
* Strict role-based access control to prevent unauthorized actions  
* Audit logs to trace key operational activities
