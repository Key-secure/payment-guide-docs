title: Budget Card Model
---

KeySecure's Budget Card system allows enterprises to share a single payment pool across all cards, enabling **flexible and controlled spending management** while **reducing capital reserve pressure**.

## I. What is the Budget Card Model?

A budget card is a **prepaid card model sharing a master account balance**. All cards draw from the same merchant budget account (USD), but each card can have individual spending rules (limits, categories, frequency, etc.).

This model is commonly used for corporate expense management, vendor payments, employee spending control, and other scenarios, **balancing payment convenience with financial governance and compliance**.

## Tips

- Merchant **budget accounts** are currently in USD by default; all transactions are settled in USD.  
- All spending, refunds, and failed transaction records are linked to the central account, simplifying reconciliation.  
- Budget can be replenished using USDT / USDC or other stablecoins; excess funds can be withdrawn as needed.
