## Backend Card Issuance Process

This process applies to all merchants issuing virtual cards via the KeySecure platform. Before launching cards to end-users, ensure all prerequisites are met and that you understand the issuance workflow to guarantee smooth operation.

Merchants must complete the following foundational steps before activating virtual card services:

### Obtain Card BIN

Activating a card BIN is a prerequisite for card issuance and usually requires completing the KYB (Know Your Business) compliance process.

- Contact the KeySecure team to submit your business information and initiate the KYB review.  
- The BIN activation timeline depends on the issuing bank and compliance review. Plan ahead to avoid delays.

### Configure KYC User Verification

All end-users must complete KYC (Know Your Customer) verification before requesting a card.

- Merchants can integrate KeySecure’s built-in KYC service or connect their own third-party provider (currently only Sumsub supported).  
- For self-managed Sumsub accounts, ensure integration is complete and successfully tested.

### Pre-Fund the Budget Account

Each card issuance consumes funds from the merchant’s budget account, covering issuance and operational fees.

- Regularly monitor the budget account balance to prevent issuance failures or delays.

### Configure App Card Packages

Merchants must create at least one card package in the backend, defining card type, fees, and other details.

- Configured packages will be visible in the end-user App for selection.



## End-User Card Application Process

When a user applies for a card via the App, the system triggers the following workflow:

<Steps>
<Step title="Step 1: User Submits Application and Makes Payment">
   The user selects a card package and pays the issuance fee. The system deducts the amount from the user’s account according to the configured payment priority.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 2: Merchant Reviews Application">
    The merchant logs into KeySecure backend, navigates to the **Card Application Records**, and reviews the user’s request.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 3: Application Outcome">
   - **If rejected:** The system refunds the issuance fee to the user account; the record status updates to **Failed**.  
   - **If approved:** The system initiates automatic card issuance with the card network; the record status updates to **Issuing**.
</Step>
<Step title="Step 4: System Processes Issuance">
  Normally, issuance completes within a few minutes, and card information is synced to the user account.  
  If the process is delayed or encounters errors, the record remains in **Issuing** status.
</Step>
</Steps>


## Card Issuance Troubleshooting Guide

If a card record remains in **Issuing** status for an extended period, check the following common causes:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|------------|
| Insufficient Budget Account Balance | The merchant budget account balance is below the cost of a single card. Replenish funds to proceed. |
| User KYC Does Not Meet Bank Requirements | Initial KYC passed, but the user’s information does not satisfy deep verification standards. Request additional documents or re-verification. |
| Merchant Account Triggered Risk Controls | Abnormal merchant activity, frequent failed transactions, or other flagged behaviors may temporarily suspend issuance. |

If the issue persists after troubleshooting, contact KeySecure support or operations team for assistance.
