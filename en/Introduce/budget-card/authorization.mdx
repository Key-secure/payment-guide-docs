## What is Authorization Check

Authorization is the core step in virtual card transactions, determining whether a user can complete a transaction. The authorization process is fully automated and consists of two main stages: **Basic Authorization Check** and **User Asset Check**. Only when both stages pass will the system issue authorization to allow the transaction to proceed.

### Stage 1: Basic Authorization Check
The system first performs preliminary validation on key card and merchant parameters to ensure the transaction can be executed under compliance and cost-control requirements.

#### Authorization Criteria
* **Card Status Verification**
  1. Verify that the user’s virtual card is in “Active” status.
  2. If the card is reported lost, frozen, or cancelled, the transaction is immediately declined.

* **Merchant Budget Account Verification**
  1. Calculate the transaction cost based on the card BIN and issuance cost rules (including base fees and settlement fees).
  2. Check if the merchant's budget account has sufficient balance to cover the transaction cost.

 **If any condition fails:** Authorization is denied immediately, the transaction is marked as “Failed,” and the user cannot complete payment.



## Stage 2: User Asset Check
Once the basic check passes, the system evaluates the user’s account to ensure sufficient funds to complete the transaction.

### Asset Verification Criteria

* **User Account Status**
  1. Verify if the user is restricted from spending (due to risk rules, blacklists, or account freezes).
  2. If restrictions exist, authorization is denied.

* **Asset Availability Assessment**
  1. Calculate the user’s ability to pay based on the transaction amount, currency, and the merchant’s configured **Payment Priority** strategy.
  2. Consider merchant parameters such as exchange rate slippage and minimum payable thresholds to ensure sufficient assets are available.

> **If user assets are insufficient:** Authorization is denied immediately, the transaction is marked as “Failed,” and the user cannot complete payment.

## Stage 3: System Approval
When both stages succeed, the system performs the following:

1. Sends the official authorization instruction to the card network to allow the transaction.
2. Freezes the corresponding amount of the user’s digital assets (in the merchant’s configured currency) and marks it as **Authorized (Pending)**.
3. Returns an authorization success response, awaiting subsequent settlement.
