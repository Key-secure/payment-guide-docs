title: Campaign List Feature
---

Merchants can configure and manage “Invite & Rebate” campaigns via the campaign list. By leveraging user referrals, this feature encourages new user registration, card issuance, and spending activities, ultimately improving user acquisition, engagement, and retention.

The feature consists of five main modules:

## Reward Rules Module
Used to create and maintain the core mechanism of the Invite & Rebate campaign. Merchants can flexibly configure invitation criteria, member levels, rebate rates, reward distribution, and clawback rules to ensure the incentive mechanism is both controllable and sustainable.

### Activity Visibility Settings
Control whether the campaign is displayed in the App frontend, with one-click activation or deactivation.

* **Enabled:** The campaign is displayed in the App, allowing users to view campaign details and participation requirements.
* **Disabled:** The campaign is hidden, used for backend data tracking or testing only.

### Valid Referrals
Defines when a formal invitation relationship is established. The system supports multiple activation triggers, selectable by the merchant:

* Successful registration
* Completed KYC verification
* Successful card issuance

<Note>
The system supports a default 2-tier invitation structure:  
Direct invitation: A enters inviter code B upon registration — A is B’s direct invitee.  
Indirect invitation: B enters code A upon registration, and C enters B’s code — C has an indirect relationship with A.
</Note>

### Member Level System Configuration
Merchants can define multiple invitation levels (up to V10) for more complex reward strategies.

* **Level Requirements:** Each level requires a certain number of valid invitees.
* **Level Rewards:**  
  Distinguish between direct and indirect relationships.  
  Supported triggers include:
  - Invitee successfully opening a card  
  - Invitee completing a qualified transaction (with configurable spending thresholds)  
  Configure rebate percentages for each trigger.

<Note>
Example: Level V3 can be set to “≥ 30 valid invitees” with a 1% rebate for direct invitees’ transactions exceeding 50 USDT.
</Note>

### Reward Settlement Rules
Define reward distribution mechanics to ensure compliance and budget control.

* **Reward Currency:** Select the payout currency (recommend stablecoins such as USDT to avoid FX volatility).
* **Settlement Cycle:**  
  - Card issuance rewards: daily settlement recommended  
  - Spending rebates: 30-day settlement recommended
* **Reward Claim Threshold:** Set a minimum claimable amount to avoid frequent payouts of small rewards and reduce operational costs.

### Reward Reversal Rules
If an invitee issues a refund, the inviter’s reward is clawed back proportionally:

Refund Reversal = Refund Amount × Rebate Percentage

By default, the amount is deducted from the inviter’s unclaimed reward pool (can go negative) to maintain a closed-loop reward model.

###Rule Copywriting
Provide clear operational text for frontend display, including but not limited to:

* Reward life cycle
* Referral Level explanation
* Reward distribution and claiming logic
* Reward clawback conditions
