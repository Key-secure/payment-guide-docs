## Overview

The “Card Issuance Records” module is used to manage and review all virtual card applications submitted by end-users. Merchants can view all submitted applications in one place and review those pending approval. This module helps track application activity, expedite the issuance process, and identify anomalies—making it a key part of daily card operations and risk control.

## Core Features

### Real-Time View of Card Applications

Displays all card issuance requests from end-users, with support for filtering and sorting by application status, including:

* **Pending Review**: Awaiting merchant approval or rejection.
* **In Progress**: The system is processing the issuance request, e.g., creating the card or binding the BIN.
* **KYC Required**: The user must upload identity documents or complete profile information before proceeding.
* **Successful**: The card has been issued and is available for use in the app.
* **Failed**: The process was interrupted or canceled by the user, and no usable card was created.

Advanced filters allow precise search by status, date, user email, merchant ID, and more.

### Reviewing Card Applications

For applications in “Pending Review” status, merchants can:

* **Approve**: Moves to the next issuance step and automatically creates the card.
* **Reject**: Terminates the application process; the user receives a rejection notification (with optional rejection reason).

### Viewing Application Details

Clicking the **[Details]** button opens a full record of the application, including:

**Basic Information**

* Merchant ID  
* Application Time  
* Status  
* Failure Reason (if applicable)

## Recommendations & Notes

1. Combine automated and manual review to improve efficiency while maintaining risk control.
2. If many applications remain in “KYC Required” status, consider optimizing the KYC process or front-end guidance text.
3. Use in conjunction with “Card BIN Settings,” “Card Packages,” and “Budget Accounts” to coordinate cost control and risk strategy.
4. Regularly export issuance data for user behavior analysis and market feedback review.
