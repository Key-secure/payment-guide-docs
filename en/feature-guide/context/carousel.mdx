## Overview

The “Carousel Management” page is used to configure marketing banners displayed across different pages of the App. This helps merchants showcase key promotions, product highlights, or important announcements as soon as users open the App, improving visibility and click-through rates. Merchants can upload images, set redirect logic, control display order, and schedule display time. Common use cases include card issuance guides, limited-time offers, and system upgrade notices.

## Features

**Upload Carousel Images**

Merchants can upload images that meet the required dimensions (recommended ratio: 16:9, supported formats: JPG/PNG) for display in the App’s homepage carousel section.

**Configure Click Redirect Links**

Each carousel image can be linked to a specific page. When clicked, users are redirected to the target feature or campaign page. Supported target pages include, but are not limited to:

* Card issuance guide page
* Promotional campaign details page
* Other in-app modules (e.g., Assets page, Top-up page)
* External marketing landing pages (must have a valid URL)

**Set Display Order and Validity Period**

* **Display Order:** Adjust by setting weights or manually sorting to prioritize important content.
* **Validity Period:** Set a start and end date/time for each carousel image. Expired images are automatically removed without manual intervention.

<Tip> 
1. Confirm that all redirect links point to live pages to avoid navigation errors affecting user experience.  
2. Avoid excessive text in images to maintain readability across different screen sizes.
