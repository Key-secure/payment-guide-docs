## Overview

The “Announcement Management” page is an operational tool for merchants to create and publish in-app notifications. It allows important information to be quickly pushed to all App users via the backend. This module supports multilingual publishing and validity period management, enabling merchants to communicate updates, product changes, system maintenance notices, or marketing campaigns in a unified, timely, and standardized manner—improving user communication efficiency and platform transparency.

## Key Features

**Create & Edit Announcements**

Merchants can create new announcements with the following configurable fields:

* **Title:** A concise summary of the notification topic for quick user recognition.  
* **Content:** Detailed information with rich-text editing support—suitable for maintenance notices, campaign rules, upgrade alerts, etc.  
* **Validity Period:** Set a start and end time; the announcement is automatically removed when expired without manual intervention.  
* **Display Order:** Assign priority weights to control announcement order, ensuring critical notices appear first.  
* **Language:** Support for multilingual versions (e.g., Chinese and English) to serve users across different regions effectively.

**Real-Time Push**

Once published, announcements are instantly pushed to all App users via in-app messages or pop-ups, ensuring timely and accurate delivery so users don’t miss important updates.

**Management & History Tracking**

Merchants can view the release history of all announcements and modify, republish, or remove them as needed—allowing flexible control over the information lifecycle.

**Example Use Cases**

* Pre-notification of system upgrades or service downtime  
* New feature release or version update details  
* Campaign rule announcements and guidance  
* User behavior reminders or policy change notices
