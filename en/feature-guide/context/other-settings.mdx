title: Other Configuration Management

## Overview
The “Other Configuration Management” page is used to set up key auxiliary content within the App, such as the User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Online Customer Support links. This module ensures platform compliance, provides essential service access points, and enhances user trust and platform professionalism.

## Feature Details:

**Upload User Agreement & Privacy Policy Links**

Merchants must upload accessible links for the User Agreement and Privacy Policy (recommended in HTTPS format). These will be automatically displayed on the App’s registration, login, and settings pages, ensuring users acknowledge and consent before using the platform.

<Note>
It is recommended to use legally binding content and ensure the links remain accessible long-term to meet regulatory compliance requirements.

**Configure Online Customer Support Links**

Merchants can configure links to embedded in-app customer service systems or external platforms (e.g., Zendesk, Intercom, WhatsApp). Users can quickly access and initiate inquiries through the App’s settings page, help center, and other entry points.

The system supports embedding third-party customer service solutions or linking to self-hosted service pages. Ensure the links are accessible across different regional network environments.
