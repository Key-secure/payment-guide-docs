## Overview

The **Member List** module enables institutions to fully track platform members (i.e., end users) by providing key identity information, asset status, and card usage details, as well as perform account-level permission management and security control actions. It serves as an important entry point for daily risk control and user support.

With this feature, institutions can quickly filter members, review essential account data, and flexibly perform management actions such as adjusting withdrawal limits, freezing operations, and unbinding security verifications, thereby improving operational efficiency and customer service capability.
