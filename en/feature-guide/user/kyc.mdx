title: KYC Verification List
---

## I. Overview

The **KYC Verification List** module allows institutional administrators to view platform members’ identity verification records and details in real time, track the status of various KYC services, and ensure platform compliance and user identity auditability.

This module consolidates all KYC verification history into a unified view, supporting filtering by user, status, and time, and allowing partial verification detail viewing. Verification data comes from your integrated KYC service provider (e.g., Sumsub or KeySecure). Some fields display only the information authorized by the SDK, while full data must be accessed through the respective service provider’s platform.

## II. Page Description

| Field Name | Description |
|------|------|
| User ID / Email | Displays the member’s unique identifier and registration info |
| Submission Time | The time the user initiated the KYC verification request |
| Verification Status | Current verification progress status (e.g., Pending Review, Approved) |

<Note>
Each KYC service request (i.e., a user submission) consumes verification credits. Please manage request frequency accordingly.
