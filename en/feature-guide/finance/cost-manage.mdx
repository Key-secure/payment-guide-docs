## Overview

The “Merchant Cost Management” page focuses on all types of business costs incurred during a merchant’s platform operations. It includes daily cumulative data and historical details, with quick links to related transaction records, helping managers gain a comprehensive view of cost consumption, track fund outflows, assess overall profitability, and optimize business strategies.

This module provides merchants with detailed analysis and visual tracking of their operational cost structure, enabling informed decision-making to improve profitability and efficiency.

## Use Cases & Recommendations

**Cost Structure Optimization**

Analyze which business types have the greatest cost impact (e.g., card issuance, spending, on-chain transactions) to refine pricing packages or adjust card BIN selection strategies.

If small transaction fee expenses are high, consider reviewing the small transaction threshold and exemption policy to reduce the share of low-value transactions.

**Profitability Analysis**

Compare cost data with revenue data from the **Merchant Revenue Management** module to calculate unit profit, gross margin, and other key metrics.

Combine with spending data to identify high-cost, low-return users or packages, and adjust segmentation strategies accordingly.

**Risk Control & Cost Alerts**

Regularly review cost details for budget reconciliation, financial audits, and compliance reporting.

Monitor fluctuations in on-chain fees and other external costs to determine whether to increase gas station balances or enable fund auto sweep mechanisms.

<Note>
All costs are converted to USD for unified reporting and aggregation;

Cost deductions may experience on-chain confirmation delays or asynchronous processing — check data refresh times accordingly;

It is recommended to use alongside “Card Issuance Records,” “Spending Records,” and “Withdrawal Records” for full data traceability.
