title: Withdrawal Records
---

## Overview

The Withdrawal Records page is used to manage withdrawal requests initiated by members (end-users) for on-chain asset transfers. It supports approval operations and full tracking of the on-chain execution status.  
This module is a core step in the digital asset cash-out process, involving manual review, wallet signing, and on-chain broadcasting to ensure fund security and compliance.

It displays all withdrawal requests submitted by members, including current status, processing progress, and on-chain execution details. Each record contains the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Member ID | Unique identifier of the member initiating the withdrawal request |
| Coin/ Network | The cryptoCointo be withdrawn |
| Withdrawal Amount | Amount of assets to be withdrawn in this request |
| Withdrawal Address | The recipient wallet address provided by the user |
| TXID | On-chain transaction hash generated after a successful withdrawal, used for blockchain lookup and traceability |
| Approval Status | Pending / Approved / Rejected |
| Approver | Account that performed the manual review |
| Approval Time | Timestamp of the manual review |

## Operation Process

Withdrawal requests follow the **“Manual Approval + MPC Wallet Automated Execution”** process to ensure secure, transparent, and controllable cash-out actions.

<Steps>
<Step title="User Submits Withdrawal Request">
    The user submits a withdrawal request in the payment app or via the relevant withdrawal interface. The system generates a pending record with the status set to "Pending".
</Step>

<Step title="Manual Review in Admin Console">
    Backend operators log in to the admin console, navigate to the Withdrawal Records module, and review each request:

Approved: Proceeds to the next step, where the system automatically calls the MPC wallet for on-chain execution.

Rejected: The request is terminated, and a rejection reason may be provided (e.g., KYC failure, mismatched withdrawal address).

<Note>
It is recommended to review the member’s identity verification status, transaction history, and alerts from anomaly detection systems to aid in the approval decision.

Automatic withdrawal policies can be configured — for example, withdrawals below a certain value can be auto-approved.
</Note>
</Step>

<Step title="System Initiates On-Chain Withdrawal">
    Once approved, the system calls the MPC wallet service to initiate the blockchain transaction.

The multi-party signing mechanism is coordinated automatically by the system (Co-signer).

Upon successful submission, a TXID (transaction hash) is generated, with a link to view on-chain details.

<Note>
A blockchain transaction is considered complete once confirmed on-chain, and the status will update to “Approved”. Otherwise, the system will automatically retry or log a failed status.

## Key Operational Requirements & Reminders

**MPC Wallet Collection Feature Must Be Enabled**

The system’s withdrawal logic depends on automated asset collection and address management to ensure a complete process chain for each withdrawal request.

**Ensure Gas Fees for Funding Addresses Are Sufficient**

All on-chain withdrawals consume gas fees. It is recommended to regularly top up native tokens (e.g., ETH, TRX) in the MPC wallet’s funding accounts to avoid withdrawal failures.

**Monitor MPC Wallet Status in Real Time**

If the wallet service goes offline or encounters signing errors, withdrawals will be directly affected.  
It is recommended to integrate with an alerting system for status monitoring and automated notifications.
