title: Deposit Records

## Overview

The “Top-up Records” page displays a complete log of digital asset deposits made by members to the merchant’s MPC wallet address via on-chain transactions. It helps merchants promptly confirm settlement status, verify deposit paths, and serves as an important reference for incoming funds.

By combining blockchain monitoring with the internal membership system, this module ensures deposit data is transparent, real-time, and traceable — making it a critical entry point for cryptoCoininflows.

### Top-up Record Fields

Each deposit record contains the following key fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Member ID | Unique ID of the member initiating the deposit request |
| Deposit Token | The cryptoCoindeposited by the user |
| Blockchain Network | The blockchain used for the deposit, e.g., Tron, Ethereum, Polygon |
| Deposit Amount | The asset amount deposited, recorded based on the actual transferred amount |
| Deposit Address | The MPC wallet sub-address assigned to the member |
| TXID | Blockchain transaction ID, with copy function for viewing in a blockchain explorer |
| Status | Pending Confirmation / Successful / Failed |

## Deposit Process Description

**Address Allocation**

Each member is assigned a unique MPC wallet deposit address.

Supports different addresses by coin/network to ensure a clear and identifiable deposit path.

**Initiating a Deposit**

The member initiates an on-chain transfer from an external wallet, sending cryptoCointo their assigned deposit address.

**Blockchain Monitoring**

The system continuously monitors transactions on each supported chain, capturing incoming transfers and matching the TXID, deposit address, and amount.

**Settlement Confirmation**

If the transaction meets the required conditions (e.g., confirmation count threshold, deposit amount above the minimum), the system automatically validates it and updates the member’s total assets.

<Warning>

On-chain deposits are irreversible. Ensure users transfer funds only to the correct system-assigned address to avoid asset loss.
